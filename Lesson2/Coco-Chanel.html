    <div class="footer"><p>The founder and namesake of the Chanel brand, she was credited in the post-World War I era with popularizing a
        sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard of style, replacing the "corseted silhouette" that was dominant
        beforehand. She is the only fashion designer listed on Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people
        of the 20th century.[3] A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond couture clothing,
        realizing her design aesthetic in jewellery, handbags, and fragrance. Her signature scent, Chanel No. 5, has
        become an iconic product, and Chanel herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, which has been in use
        since the 1920s.</p></div>
